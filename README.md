# Deployment Lab - Landing Page

Welcome to the Deployment Lab! In this lab, we'll build a simple landing page and deploy it to an AWS EC2 instance. The objective is to gain hands-on experience with setting up an Express server, deploying the landing page, and making incremental updates to the deployed version.

## Lab Objectives

1. Set up a basic HTML template for the landing page.
2. Create an Express server to render the HTML page.
3. Deploy the landing page to an AWS EC2 instance.
4. Gradually build out the landing page with additional features and continuously redeploy it.

## Getting Started

To get started with the lab, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.

3. Install the necessary dependencies for the Express server:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the Express server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Access the landing page by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

## Deploying to EC2 Instance

To deploy the landing page to an EC2 instance, follow these steps:

1. Launch an EC2 instance on AWS.

2. Connect to your EC2 instance using EC2 Instance Connect.

3. Upload the landing page files to the EC2 instance.

4. Install Node.js and npm on the EC2 instance (if not already installed).

5. Install project dependencies on the EC2 instance:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

6. Start the Express server on the EC2 instance:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

7. Access your landing page by visiting your EC2 instance's public IP address or domain name in your web browser.

## Incremental Feature Additions

To make the lab more interesting and challenging, try adding new features to the landing page one at a time. Redeploy the page after each addition to see the changes in action. Some ideas for additional features include:

- Adding a header and an image.
- Including a description section.
- Styling the page using CSS.
- Creating API endpoints to serve static files and data.
- Connecting a database to the app for data storage.

Feel free to be creative and make this landing page your own!

## Going Further

The deployment lab offers a great foundation for building more complex web applications. You can extend the project further by:

- Implementing user authentication and authorization.
- Creating a back-end API to handle user interactions.
- Incorporating a front-end framework like React or Vue.js.
- Setting up automated testing and continuous integration.

Have fun exploring and building!
